						Training & Placement Cell compliments the efforts of the members of faculty by 
						organizing value-addition programmes and providing placement opportunities to students. 
						It acts as one of the major interfaces with the corporate sector and helps in developing 
						the industry-academia inter-relationship.

						Training : The Cell organizes certain orientation programmes, grooming sessions, 
						mock interview sessions for students of each stream. Besides, the Cell organizes various 
						summer internship programmes for students to provide them with hands-on experience and 
						introducing them to the professional environment.

						NJ, USA for a student exchange programme under which the first batch of 20 students had a 6-week
						training programme at NJIT during 2008 and the second batch of students are also undergoing 
						training programme at present.
