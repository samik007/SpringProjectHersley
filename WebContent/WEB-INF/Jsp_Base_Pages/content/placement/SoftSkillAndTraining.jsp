						Outreach

						Training and Placement are very active to ensure a continuous dialogue with the Corporates 
						so as to follow up with them on their recruitment drive and ensure that we get the best 
						recruiters to come to our campus as the number one slot and take the cream of the recruits. 
						Efforts are on through out the year for recruitments, and every endeavour is made to build 
						new relationships and broaden our base of recruiters.

						Career Guidance Cell

						The Training & Placement Office organizes various training and development programmes for 
						faculties and students. This includes a regular communication and liaising with Corporates 
						and other consulting trainers and schedule for such kind of trainings in-house or in the trainer’s premises.
						We also develop partnership with companies like Wipro Technologies Limited, Infosys Technologies 
						Limited and TCS to develop and entrain our faculties so that they acquire new skills on the latest 
						cutting edge technologies and also that our faculties and students learn the best technological 
						practices and also the soft skills.

						With programmes like Wipro’s Fast Forward, Infosys Campus Connect and TCS “Sparsh” have added more 
						feathers in our cap as these were the exclusive programmes which happened for Heritage Institute of 
						Technology and our faculty and students were benefited at large.

						We are associated with some Consulting organizations like HLS India, IBM, Ardent Collaborations, 
						Micro Pro and Prime who have been providing the summer training and also the pre campus recruitment 
						training to our third year students every year. This training methodology helps our students to develop 
						and perform the industry level requirements during their campus recruitment and as a result we are 
						achieving milestones in the number of students placed every year.
	
						Training & Placement Office also perceives to harness a Career Guidance Cell which would act as a 
						vista for the students to the world of foreign higher education. This Cell would serve purpose to 
						those students who seek right guidance in case they want to pursue higher education in different 
						foreign and national universities offering scholarships. This Cell also needs to be equipped with the 
						information regarding examinations like GRE, GMAT, CAT, XAT, GATE etc. so that the students is fully 
						informed about the various options to pursue higher studies after graduation.
